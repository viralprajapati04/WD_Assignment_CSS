 Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there's a wider range of browser support.
 Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility.

Q-4: Name a few CSS style components ?
Ans:
1) Selector: This is the HTML element or elements that the style will be applied to. Examples include h1, p, .class-name, or #id-name.
2) Property: The specific aspect of the element that you want to style, such as color, font-size, background-color, etc.
3) Value: The value assigned to the property, such as red, 16px, or #ffffff.

Q-5:What do you understand by CSS opacity?
Ans:CSS opacity is a property that controls the transparency of an element. It takes a value between 0 and 1:   
0: The element is completely transparent (invisible).   
1: The element is completely opaque (visible).   
Values between 0 and 1: The element is partially transparent, allowing the background to show through.   

Q-6:How can the background color of an element be changed? 
Ans:Use the CSS background-color property to add a background colour to HTML. Put it
 into a style attribute and change the value to the desired colour name or code. Then
 include this style attribute in an HTML element, such as a heading, span tag, table, or div.
 Now, let’s say you want to modify the background colour of a certain element while keeping 
 the background colour of your entire website the same. The good news is that the steps for
 adding and changing an element’s background colour are remarkably similar.

 There are three ways to change the HTML background colour:

1)  Using the bgcolor attribute
2)  Inline CSS 
3)  Internal Stylesheet 

Q-7:How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?  
Ans:This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control
 the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background 
image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

Q-8:What is the use of the background-position property?
Ans:he background-position property in CSS is used to specify the position of a background image within
 an element. It allows you to control where the image starts relative to the element's top-left corner. 
 The property takes two values, separated by a space:
First value: Specifies the horizontal position (e.g., left, center, right, or a pixel value).
Second value: Specifies the vertical position (e.g., top, center, bottom, or a pixel value).

Q-9:Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
Ans:The background-attachment property in CSS controls whether a background image scrolls with the page content or remains fixed in place.
Here are the possible values for background-attachment:
1.scroll: The image scrolls with the page content (default).   
2.fixed: The image remains fixed in place, even as the page content scrolls.
3.local: The image scrolls with the element itself, rather than the entire page.

Q-10:Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
Ans:Separating background and color properties in CSS is essential for flexibility, maintainability, and reusability.
Here's a breakdown of the reasons:
Flexibility:
Independent Control: By using separate properties, you can modify the background color and image independently
 without affecting the other. This provides more granular control over your design.
Multiple Backgrounds: CSS allows you to layer multiple background images with different properties, such as opacity,
 position, and repetition. Separating background and color properties makes this easier to manage.
Maintainability:
Easier Updates: When you need to change the background color or image, you can do so directly without affecting the
 other properties. This reduces the risk of introducing unintended side effects.
Modular Design: Separating these properties promotes a modular approach to styling, making your CSS code more organized and easier to understand.
Reusability:
Shared Styles: You can create reusable style classes that define the background color and image separately. This
 allows you to apply the same styles to multiple elements on your page, saving time and effort.
Customization: By separating these properties, you can easily customize the appearance of elements without having to rewrite the entire style definition.

Q-11:How to center block elements using CSS1?  
Ans:1. Center block elements using margin property: We need to specify the margin from left and right such that it looks centered. We do not need 
to do this manually, we have one property value “auto” which will automatically set the margin such that our block element is placed in the center.

Q-12:How to maintain the CSS specifications? 
Ans:Maintaining CSS specifications involves ensuring that your styles are consistent, up-to-date, and compatible across
 different browsers and devices. Here are some key strategies:
1. Use a CSS Preprocessor
2. Follow CSS Best Practices
3. Leverage CSS Frameworks
4. Test Across Browsers and Devices
5. Stay Updated with CSS Standards
6. Use Version Control
7. Consider CSS Modules
8. Optimize for Performance
9. Regular Code Reviews

Q-13:What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?  
Ans:CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline
 CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal 
stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML

Q-14:What is embedded style sheets?
Ans:Embedded style sheets are CSS rules that are directly embedded within the <head> section of an HTML document. This method 
allows you to define styles for specific elements within the same file as your HTML content.
Advantages:
Simple and straightforward: Easy to implement for small-scale styling.
No external files: No need for separate CSS files.
Disadvantages:
Limited reusability: Styles defined within an embedded style sheet are specific to that particular HTML document.
Poor organization: Can make your HTML code less readable and maintainable, especially for larger projects.

Q-15:What are the external style sheets?
Ans:External style sheets are CSS rules that are defined in a separate .css file and linked to your HTML document using the 
<link> element. This method provides several benefits, including better organization, maintainability, and reusability.
Benefits:
Improved organization: Separates your HTML and CSS code, making your project easier to manage and understand.
Reusability: Styles defined in external style sheets can be reused across multiple HTML pages, saving time and effort.
Maintainability: Changes to your styles can be made in a single place without affecting your HTML code.
Caching: Browsers can cache external style sheets, improving page load times.

Q-16:What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?  
Ans:Advantages of Using External Style Sheets
1.Improved Organization: Separates HTML and CSS, making the code easier to manage and understand.
2.Reusability: Styles can be reused across multiple HTML pages, saving time and effort.
3.Maintainability: Changes to styles can be made in a single place without affecting your HTML code.
4.Caching: Browsers can cache external style sheets, improving page load times.
5.Separation of Concerns: Enforces the principle of separation of concerns, making your code more modular and maintainable.

Disadvantages of Using External Style Sheets
1.Additional HTTP Request: Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file, which can slightly increase page load time.
2.Potential for Blocking Render: If the CSS file is large or the network connection is slow, it can block rendering of the page content until it's loaded.
3.Dependency: Your HTML pages become dependent on the external CSS file, which can introduce potential issues if the file is missing or inaccessible.

Q-17: What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
Ans:A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other
terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property 
values inside the rule applied to them.

Q-18:What are the media types allowed by CSS?  
Ans:CSS media types are used to specify different styles for different output devices or conditions. They allow you to create
 responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes, orientations, and print media.   
Here are the commonly used CSS media types:
screen: Targets computer screens and devices with a screen.
print: Targets printers and print media.   
speech: Targets speech synthesis devices.
projection: Targets projectors and other presentation devices.
tty: Targets teletype devices (e.g., terminals).   
all: Targets all media types.

Q-19:What is the rule set? 
Ans:A collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against to 
determine an action to take—such as forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or allowing a system event.
